# Airbnb Analytical Case Study
Over the last five years, Airbnb management have witnessed an intriguing trend that suggests a correlation between the number of property images associated with a listing and the number of bookings it attracts. Client has also noticed an overwhelming number of listings being redundant, due to lack of any associated images.  

1. Management needs help to decide upon a minimum number of images to be made mandatory for a listing that would ensure bookings.  
2. Also, come up with an optimal number of images that we can suggest the host to post along with a listing that would attract the most bookings and ensure success.
